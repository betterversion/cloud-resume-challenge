## Cloud Infrastructure & Automation Engineer

Automation engineer transitioning to cloud infrastructure after architecting platforms at scale. At Zillow, I evolved from SDET to building CI/CD frameworks used by 7 teams and contributing to AWS migrations that cut costs by 40% while serving 2M+ monthly transactions.

### What Makes Me Different

**I build infrastructure that scales** - not just tests that pass. My background in automation means I approach cloud engineering with a unique perspective: every system should be self-healing, every deployment should be automated, and every dollar should be optimized.

**Technical Expertise**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront)
- **Automation**: CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Python, Bash
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes fundamentals

### This Site Proves It

While this resume appears deceptively simple, it runs on production-grade infrastructure I built from scratch:

- **True blue-green deployments** enabling zero-downtime releases
- **2,000+ lines of Terraform** managing 30+ AWS resources
- **Enterprise patterns** at <$5/month operational cost
- **10-minute deployments** from code to production

This isn't a tutorial project - it's how I approach infrastructure. The same patterns powering this site have served millions at Zillow.
