# 🌐 Day 7: API Gateway Mastery & Professional Domain Architecture

## 🎯 Objective

Transform functional Lambda backend into enterprise-grade API infrastructure with professional domain mapping, comprehensive CORS security, production monitoring, and executive-level dashboards. Establish API Gateway deployment patterns and custom domain integration.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: REST API Foundation & Multi-Endpoint Architecture

* Created professional API Gateway REST API with logical resource hierarchy:
  ```
  API: resume-visitor-api-prod
  Resources:
    / (root)
    ├── /counter (visitor counter business logic)
    └── /health (operational monitoring)
  ```
* **Integration Pattern**: Lambda Proxy Integration with existing `resume-visitor-counter` function
* **Method Configuration**: GET methods on both endpoints routing to same Lambda with path-based logic
* **Architecture Decision**: Single API Gateway managing multiple endpoints vs separate APIs per function
* **Lambda Routing**: Function already supported multi-endpoint via `event.get('path')` parameter
* ✅ Clean REST API structure ready for production deployment

---

## 🔒 Phase 2: CORS Configuration Mastery & Security Implementation

* Implemented domain-specific CORS restrictions for enhanced security:
  ```python
  'headers': {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://www.dzresume.dev',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
      'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff'
  }
  ```
* **Security Pattern**: Specific domain restriction vs wildcard (`*`) to prevent resource abuse
* **Challenge**: Understanding CORS browser enforcement vs server-side policy declaration
* **Learning**: CORS headers always returned by server, but only browsers enforce restrictions
* **Professional Headers**: Content-type protection and cache control for dynamic data
* ✅ Production-grade CORS security preventing unauthorized cross-origin access

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Multi-Endpoint Testing & CORS Validation

* **Test 1 - Counter Endpoint**: API Gateway URL with `/counter` path
  ```bash
  curl -X GET https://ae348o36ad.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/counter
  Response: {"count": 21, "timestamp": "2025-05-30T20:43:27.132270", "status": "success"}
  ```
* **Test 2 - Health Endpoint**: Operational monitoring validation
  ```bash
  curl -X GET https://ae348o36ad.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/health
  Response: {"status": "healthy", "service": "visitor-counter", "database": "connected"}
  ```
* **Test 3 - CORS Browser Validation**: Cross-origin request from allowed domain
  ```javascript
  fetch('https://api-url/counter').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
  Result: ✅ No CORS errors, successful response
  ```
* **CORS Learning**: curl bypasses CORS (no browser enforcement), browsers validate Origin headers
* ✅ Complete API functionality verified with proper CORS behavior

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Production Stage Deployment & Resource Protection

* **Production Stage Configuration**:
  ```
  Stage: prod
  CloudWatch Logging: INFO level enabled
  Detailed Metrics: Enabled for comprehensive monitoring
  Cache Settings: Disabled (dynamic counter data)
  Request/Response Logging: Full logging enabled
  ```
* **Usage Plan Implementation**: Resource protection and cost management
  ```
  Plan: ResumeProdUsagePlan
  Rate Limit: 100 requests/second
  Burst Capacity: 200 requests
  Daily Quota: 10,000 requests
  Associated Stage: prod
  ```
* **Professional Pattern**: Production-specific configuration vs development settings
* **Cost Protection**: Throttling prevents runaway automation from generating unexpected bills
* **Monitoring Integration**: CloudWatch logs provide API Gateway layer visibility
* ✅ Production-ready deployment with comprehensive resource protection

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Executive Dashboard Creation & Business Intelligence

* **Three-Layer Monitoring Architecture**: Complete request lifecycle visibility
  ```
  Layer 1: API Gateway (request counts, latency, errors)
  Layer 2: Lambda (duration, invocations, concurrent executions)
  Layer 3: DynamoDB (capacity utilization, operation latency)
  ```
* **Business Intelligence Widgets**: Transforming operational data into executive insights
  ```sql
  -- Hourly Visitor Activity Pattern
  fields @timestamp
  | filter @message like /visitor_counter_success/
  | stats count() as requests by bin(1h)
  | sort @timestamp desc
  | limit 168

  -- Daily Growth Trend Analysis
  fields @timestamp, @message
  | parse @message /counter to (?<visitor_count>\d+)/
  | stats max(visitor_count) as daily_total by bin(1d)
  | sort @timestamp desc
  | limit 30
  ```
* **Dashboard Innovation**: CloudWatch Insights queries extracting business metrics from application logs
* **Cost Efficiency**: Zero additional infrastructure using existing CloudWatch capabilities
* ✅ Executive-level monitoring with business intelligence integration

---

## 🌍 Phase 6: SSL Certificate Provisioning & Domain Validation

* **AWS Certificate Manager Configuration**:
  ```
  Primary Domain: api.dzresume.dev
  Additional: *.api.dzresume.dev (future subdomain support)
  Validation Method: DNS validation (more automated than email)
  Key Algorithm: RSA 2048 (web standard)
  ```
* **DNS Validation Process**: Proving domain ownership through Cloudflare records
  ```dns
  Type: CNAME
  Name: _acme-challenge.api
  Target: [AWS ACM validation string]
  Proxy Status: DNS only (required for validation)
  ```
* **Challenge**: Certificate validation timing and exact record matching requirements
* **Resolution**: Precise CNAME record creation with 5-10 minute propagation wait
* **Validation Success**: Certificate status changed from "Pending" to "Issued"
* ✅ SSL certificate validated and ready for API Gateway integration

---

## 🔧 Phase 7: API Gateway Custom Domain Integration

* **Custom Domain Configuration**:
  ```
  Domain: api.dzresume.dev
  Certificate: Linked to validated ACM certificate
  Security Policy: TLS 1.2 (modern standard)
  Endpoint Type: Regional (cost-effective for single region)
  ```
* **API Mapping Setup**: Root path routing to production stage
  ```
  API: resume-visitor-api-prod
  Stage: prod
  Path: (empty - root mapping)
  Result: api.dzresume.dev/counter maps to prod stage /counter
  ```
* **Target Domain**: AWS provided CloudFront distribution endpoint
  ```
  Target: d-abc123xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  Purpose: Internal routing destination for Cloudflare CNAME
  ```
* ✅ Professional domain mapping eliminating AWS-generated URLs

---

## 🌐 Phase 8: Cloudflare DNS Integration & CDN Optimization

* **Production CNAME Record**: Routing traffic from custom domain to AWS
  ```dns
  Type: CNAME
  Name: api (creates api.dzresume.dev)
  Target: d-abc123xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  Proxy Status: Proxied (orange cloud - CDN enabled)
  TTL: Auto
  ```
* **CDN Benefits**: Cloudflare proxy provides global edge caching and DDoS protection
* **Architecture Pattern**: DNS → CDN → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB request flow
* **Professional URLs**: Clean branded endpoints vs exposing internal infrastructure
* ✅ Global CDN integration with professional domain architecture

---

## 🧪 Phase 9: End-to-End Professional API Validation

* **Custom Domain Testing**: Complete functionality verification
  ```bash
  # Counter endpoint via professional domain
  curl -i https://api.dzresume.dev/counter
  HTTP/2 200
  access-control-allow-origin: https://www.dzresume.dev
  {"count": 21, "timestamp": "2025-05-30T20:43:27.132270", "status": "success"}

  # Health endpoint validation
  curl -i https://api.dzresume.dev/health
  HTTP/2 200
  {"status": "healthy", "service": "visitor-counter", "database": "connected"}
  ```
* **Performance Metrics**: Professional API response characteristics
  ```
  Protocol: HTTP/2 (automatic with valid SSL)
  Response Time: ~50ms average
  SSL Handshake: Valid certificate for api.dzresume.dev
  CDN Integration: Cloudflare edge optimization
  ```
* **CORS Browser Validation**: Cross-origin security verification
  ```javascript
  // From allowed domain (dzresume.dev) - Success
  fetch('https://api.dzresume.dev/counter').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)

  // From disallowed domain (google.com) - Blocked by browser
  // CORS policy blocks cross-origin request due to domain restriction
  ```
* ✅ Complete professional API infrastructure operational with enterprise security
